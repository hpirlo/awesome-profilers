# Awesome Profilers
Awesome list of different profilers for memory, performance, and others in various operating systems.

## Memory Profilers
### Linux
* [heaptrack](https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack) - A heap memory profiler for Linux.
* [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) - Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools.
* [memtester](https://linux.die.net/man/8/memtester) - stress test to find memory subsystem faults.

## Performance Profilers
### Linux
* [perf_events](https://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) - An event-oriented observability tool that can help you solve advanced performance and troubleshooting functions.
* [LTTng](https://lttng.org/) - LTTng is an open-source tracing framework for Linux.
* [Sysprof](https://www.sysprof.com/) - Sysprof is a statistical, system-wide profiler for Linux.
* [gprof](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gprof-2.9.1/html_mono/gprof.html) - The GNU Profiler.
* [OProfile](https://oprofile.sourceforge.io/) - OProfile is an open-source project that includes a statistical profiler for Linux systems, capable of profiling all running code at low overhead.
* [SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) - SystemTap provides free software (GPL) infrastructure to simplify the gathering of information about the running Linux system.

## Tracing Tools
* [bpftrace](https://bpftrace.org/) - High-level tracing language for Linux systems.
* [ftrace](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.0/trace/ftrace.html) - Ftrace is an internal tracer designed to help system developers and designers understand what is happening inside the kernel.
* [ltrace](https://ltrace.org/) - ltrace intercepts and records dynamic library calls that are called by an executed process and the signals received by that process.
